# OSS Readiness Review

Last updated: 2026-07-22
Reviewed: 2026-05-01 by Xiaomi MiMo V2.5 Pro; refreshed 2026-07-24 after the verified continuation-runtime pass.

## Score

Current v2 branch OSS readiness: 8.0/10

This score is for the current Context Compiler v2 working tree, not a public
release tag. It reflects implemented backend/runtime persistence, compiler,
API/CLI prepare surfaces, MCP bridge behavior, and passing backend tests, while
still calling out final hardening gaps below.

## What Is Working

- FastAPI backend runs as a single process with SQLite by default.
- Source ingestion, extraction, graph reads, query, connectors, and AI-context import have tests.
- Knowledge graph responses include source provenance and proposed future context.
- SQLite startup migration covers the new relationship confidence/evidence fields.
- SQLite/SQLAlchemy schemas now create compound indexes for source-document
  sync lookup, pending extraction, component filtering, and relationship
  traversal.
- Connector API now avoids marking Slack as connected when no tested sync path exists.
- AI-context subtype documents are counted together in connector processing summary.
- Demo seed endpoint creates source-backed GitHub, Slack, Gmail, Google Drive, and Codex documents without faking connector auth state.
- Frontend tests guard the project-first routes, repository intake, visual
  session relevance, landing claims, source flows, and connector honesty.
- Launch-facing docs now cover setup, contributing, architecture, connectors,
  AI Context, the project map, MCP, and the seeded demo walkthrough.
- MCP examples now include copy-paste installed/local checkout configs and an
  agent grounding prompt tied to `query_context` and `trace.facts_used`.
- The Project map replaces the older Cytoscape Board/Explore implementation,
  minimap, layout chooser, and duplicate quick-inspection surfaces.
- Query returns a deterministic source-backed answer summary when no AI answer model is configured.
- Query status/confidence filtering now runs in SQL before semantic/lexical ranking.
- Source Manager now uses the shared frontend API client instead of raw fetch
  calls, and separates unsupported/historical provider records from supported
  document imports.
- Landing/mock frontend copy now uses launch-available source families only,
  and unsupported Notion/Zoom manual-connect UI paths are removed.
- Frontend smoke coverage now guards connector honesty: coming-soon providers
  stay disabled and launch connectors expose only backend-backed actions.
- Community health files now include a security policy, bug and feature issue
  forms, and a PR template tied to provenance, evidence, and connector honesty.
- `scripts/smoke.sh` now gives maintainers a repeatable local launch gate and
  optional Docker API smoke before release tags.
- `scripts/doctor.sh` gives first-time users and contributors a read-only
  checkout/prerequisite diagnosis for Docker and bare-metal setup before they
  commit to setup, demo, or smoke commands.
- Bare-metal setup now creates `.venv`, validates Python versions with
  `sys.version_info`, uses `npm ci`, and the start/dev/smoke scripts reuse that
  interpreter automatically.
- CLI ingest now carries `--sync` through to both single-source and bulk-source
  HTTP paths, and the bulk source API processes synchronously when requested.
- README and demo quick-start commands use the real GitHub remote with an
  explicit `context-engine` checkout directory, and docs coverage guards
  against placeholder clone URLs.
- Package metadata now advertises the MIT license, repository/issues URLs,
  relevant keywords, and PyPI classifiers; the package metadata dry run passes,
  and Docker copies `LICENSE` before `pip install .` prepares metadata.
- CI runs backend tests, Ruff, frontend tests, frontend build, Docker image build,
  and smoke-compose config validation.
- Connector tests now describe Slack as OAuth/setup-backed and direct-connect
  rejected, instead of carrying stale unsupported-connector wording.
- Frontend build passes.
- Implemented in this branch: evidence spans, claims, claim revisions, context
  packs, context pack items, agent runs, run observations, and repo-index tables
  are present in SQLAlchemy metadata and migration tests.
- Implemented in this branch: MCP `prepare_task` calls the compiler service
  when importable, returns `compiler_unavailable` only when the service is
  absent during branch integration, and validates the returned pack ID, stored
  manifest, and stored markdown before returning success.
- Implemented in this branch: MCP runtime write tools persist agent events,
  decisions, blockers, patch summaries, verification evidence, and task close
  evidence without code edits, shell execution, git pushes, or provider writes.
- Implemented in this branch: context compiler eval fixtures and metric helpers
  cover recall, precision, evidence coverage against final citation fields,
  stale leakage, conflict detection, token efficiency, and verification-command
  presence on fixtures.
- Implemented in this branch: `/app` is the primary Continue view. Library,
  History, Memory, and Evidence are secondary inspection surfaces; Sources and
  Integrations are setup surfaces. The legacy `/app/prepare` route preserves
  query parameters while redirecting to Continue. Durable continuation is
  available through HTTP, `ctxe continue`, and MCP `resume_task`.
- Implemented in this branch: source objects use workspace-scoped append-only
  revisions, and MCP `record_agent_run_finish` links an exact pack to terminal
  repository and verification observations without claiming causal lift.

## Verification

```bash
pytest -q
cd frontend && npm run build
```

Latest verified result from the 2026-07-24 continuation-runtime pass:

- `pytest -q`: 798 passed, 1 skipped, 1 SQLite datetime deprecation warning.
- `ruff check app tests`: passed.
- `cd frontend && npm test -- --run`: 23 files, 178 tests passed.
- `cd frontend && npm run build`: passed.

Not verified in this pass:

- Docker smoke.
- PostgreSQL-specific concurrency and migration integration; SQLite regression
  coverage and dialect-specific migration SQL are present.

## Remaining Launch Blockers

### P0

- Resolved 2026-06-17: `LICENSE` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` now exist.
- No P0 blocker is currently identified in the backend test pass.

### P1

- MCP runtime write tools do not yet implement idempotency keys, so repeated
  client calls can create duplicate source evidence.
- The context compiler eval fixture defines metrics and expected context, but it
  is not a benchmark or solve-rate proof.
- Keep `docs/mcp.md` synchronized: the runtime write tools and prepare bridge
  are implemented, while the longer contract section remains proposed hardening.
- Keep connector documentation synchronized with the backend catalog. Current README status is authoritative for launch copy.
- Run `bash scripts/smoke.sh --docker` from a fresh clone before a public
  release tag.

### P2

- Compiler ranking is deterministic and source-backed, but still a first-pass
  heuristic; larger installs need richer candidate retrieval and reranking.
- The frontend inspects persisted `context_pack.v2` output, but does not yet
  provide a separate browser for historical `AgentRun` observations.
- MCP `query_context` uses the indexed query filter path, but semantic scoring
  still ranks candidate components in process. Larger installs will still need
  indexed semantic retrieval.
- Extractor logs LLM extraction failures and falls back to regex; richer operator surfacing would still help in the UI.
- Dependency freshness and image size should be reviewed before public launch.

### Frontend Catalog (hooks.js lines 73-154)

| Type | availability | In Backend? |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| slack | available | Yes |
| discord | coming_soon | Yes |
| ai_context | available | Yes |
| local | available | Yes |
| zoom | coming_soon | Yes |
| gdrive | available | Yes |
| gmail | available | Yes |
| wispr_flow | coming_soon | Yes |

### Frontend Hooks Without Working Backend Paths

No launch-facing frontend hook now calls Notion or Zoom manual-connect routes.
Coming-soon connectors render disabled actions, while GitHub, Slack, Gmail, and
Google Drive use backend-backed setup paths.
Backend setup routes also reject direct Zoom OAuth/manual-token and Notion
token attempts so they cannot create fake connected provider state.

### Implemented

- Local source upload through Sources.
- AI Context import through `/api/connectors/ai-context/import`.
- Connector catalog/status/sync-job contract.
- Query API has a versioned `query.v1` response with retrieval controls and facts-used trace.
- Context packs can be generated from a selected graph component plus 1-hop neighbors.
- `/api/seed-demo` creates an idempotent source-backed demo workspace using launch-available source families only.

### Not Implemented Yet

- Discord sync.
- Zoom and Wispr provider sync.
- Notion catalog/provider backend.
